# üî≠ Hubble - Intelligent Bookmark Dashboard with MCP Integration

## üéØ Project Overview
Hubble is a modern, self-hosted bookmark dashboard designed for developers and teams managing multiple projects. Unlike traditional bookmark managers, Hubble provides programmatic access via MCP (Model Context Protocol) for automatic bookmark synchronization and intelligent organization.

**Project Domain**: https://hubble.blockonauts.io (to be configured)
**Frontend Port**: 8888
**Backend API Port**: 8889  
**MCP Server Port**: 9900

## üìÅ PROJECT ORGANIZATION RULES - MANDATORY
**CRITICAL**: Keep the codebase clean and organized at all times
- All current working documentation MUST go in `/home/jarvis/projects/Hubble/docs/active-workload/`
- Completed documentation should be moved to appropriate `/docs/` subdirectories
- NEVER leave documentation files in project root or scattered in code directories
- Use clear, descriptive filenames with proper prefixes (e.g., `MCP-`, `API-`, `DATABASE-`, `UI-`)
- Keep README files minimal and point to `/docs/` for detailed documentation

## üö® CRITICAL: Development Environment
**IMPORTANT**: We work on a headless Ubuntu server
- Domain: hubble.blockonauts.io
- Nginx reverse proxy with port jump configured
- Docker and Docker Compose available
- SQLite for database (portable, simple)
- MCP SDK available for integration

## üö® CRITICAL: Development Environment
**IMPORTANT**: Always check if the docker container are up and running and health 
before you tell Andre the system is ready.
- Always make sure you deployed the frontend or backend changes
- Always make sure you update the versioning and new features or fixes in the UI

## üö® CRITICAL: Git Updates
**IMPORTANT**: Always create new PRs with any feature changes you deployed.

  color, sort_order, created_at, updated_at
)

-- Bookmarks table
bookmarks (
  id, group_id, title, url, description, icon,
  tags, color, environment, health_status,
  click_count, created_by, metadata
)

-- Analytics and audit tables
analytics (event tracking)
mcp_audit (MCP operation logging)
```

## üéØ Success Metrics
- Page load: <500ms
- Search results: <50ms  
- MCP response: <100ms
- Support 1000+ bookmarks
- Handle 100+ concurrent MCP clients

## üîß Development Workflow

### Starting New Work
1. Add tasks using betty-tasks.py
2. Check existing project structure
3. Follow the implementation phases
4. Test thoroughly before marking complete

### Docker Commands
```bash
# Build and start services
docker-compose up -d

# Restart specific service
docker-compose restart [service]

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f [service]

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for API endpoints
- Integration tests for MCP operations
- E2E tests for user workflows
- Performance tests for scalability

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### General Rules
- Never use mocked data - implement real functionality
- Never delete files without backup
- Test thoroughly before declaring complete
- Follow existing Betty project patterns where applicable
- Use MCP tools for testing and verification

### UI/UX Principles
- Clean, modern design with ample whitespace
- Developer-centric (not home lab focused)
- Mobile responsive
- Accessibility first (WCAG AAA)
- Subtle animations with Framer Motion

### Integration Examples
Projects can auto-register their bookmarks on startup:
```javascript
// Any project can register with Hubble
await mcpClient.callTool('add_bookmark', {
  title: 'My Service',
  url: 'https://service.example.com',
  group: 'ProjectName',
  subgroup: 'Production',
  icon: 'üöÄ',
  tags: ['api', 'production']
});
```

# Multi-Agent Orchestration

**CRITICAL**: Leverage specialized sub-agents for complex tasks

## Available Specialized Agents
- **general-purpose**: For complex searches, multi-step tasks
- **frontend-developer**: For React UI implementation
- **backend-architect**: For API and database design
- **devops-automator**: For Docker and deployment setup
- **test-writer-fixer**: For comprehensive test coverage
- **mcp-specialist**: For MCP protocol implementation (if available)

## Agent Usage Rules
- Analyze what specialists are needed before starting
- Use Task tool to delegate to appropriate specialists
- Use multiple agents concurrently when possible
- Your role is orchestrator and integrator
